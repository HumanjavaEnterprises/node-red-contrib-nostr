# node-red-contrib-nostr

A [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) node for integrating with the Nostr protocol. This node allows you to connect to Nostr relays, publish events, and subscribe to events in the Nostr network.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

A private key is **only required** if you want to:
- Publish events to relays
- Send encrypted direct messages
- Perform any action that requires signing

For just listening to relays or subscribing to events, **no private key is needed**.

If you do need to publish events, follow these security guidelines:

1. Generate a separate key pair specifically for your Node-RED automation using services like:
   - [nsec.app](https://nsec.app/)
   - [Alby](https://getalby.com/)
   - [Nostr.band](https://nostr.band/)

2. Keep the scope of this automation key limited:
   - Only give it permissions it actually needs
   - Consider it like a "bot account"
   - Regularly rotate the key if possible

3. Store the private key securely:
   - Use Node-RED's encrypted credentials
   - Never share or expose the key
   - Don't commit it to version control

## Description

This package provides nodes for interacting with Nostr relays, allowing you to:
- Connect to multiple relays simultaneously
- Monitor specific NPUBs for events
- Filter events by type (text notes, DMs, etc.)
- Post events to relays (using a dedicated automation key)
- Support for multiple NIPs (see Supported NIPs section)
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Secure credential management
- Automatic reconnection handling

## Robust WebSocket Handling

This package uses [nostr-websocket-utils](https://github.com/yourusername/nostr-websocket-utils), a purpose-built library for handling Nostr WebSocket connections with enterprise-grade reliability:

- **Automatic Reconnection**: Smart backoff strategy for handling connection drops
- **Connection Health**: Built-in heartbeat monitoring to detect stale connections
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all Nostr message types
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup of resources and event listeners
- **Debug Support**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting connection issues

## Example Flows

The package includes several example flows that demonstrate common use cases:

### 1. Monitor Jack's Posts
A flow that monitors Jack Dorsey's Nostr posts in real-time:
```json
{
    "name": "Monitor Jack's Posts",
    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": "relay-config",
            "type": "nostr-relay-config",
            "name": "Main Relays",
            "relay1": "wss://relay.damus.io",
            "relay2": "wss://nos.lol",
            "relay3": "wss://relay.nostr.band",
            "pingInterval": 30
        },
        {
            "id": "jack-monitor",
            "type": "nostr-relay",
            "name": "Jack's Posts",
            "relayConfig": "relay-config",
            "npub": "npub1sg6plzptd64u62a878hep2kev88swjh3tw00gjsfl8yz5tc68qysh7j4xz",
            "eventKinds": [1]
        }
    ]
}
```

To import this flow:
1. Open Node-RED
2. Click the menu (‚â°) button
3. Select Import ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí node-red-contrib-nostr
4. Choose "Monitor Jack's Posts"

Other example flows include:
- Basic Relay Connection: Simple example of connecting to a Nostr relay
- Multi-User Monitor: Monitor multiple Nostr users simultaneously

## Usage

### Relay Configuration

1. Add a new "nostr-relay-config" node
2. Configure up to 3 relay URLs (e.g., wss://relay.damus.io)
3. Set your private key (securely stored in credentials)
4. Configure auto-reconnect settings

### Event Publishing

```javascript
msg.payload = {
    type: "publish",
    content: {
        kind: 1,              // Event kind (1 for note)
        content: "Hello Nostr!",
        tags: [               // Optional tags
            ["t", "node-red"],
            ["t", "automation"]
        ]
    }
}
```

### Event Subscription

```javascript
msg.payload = {
    type: "subscribe",
    content: {
        filters: [{
            kinds: [1, 6, 7],    // Text notes, reposts, reactions
            authors: ["<pubkey>"],
            "#t": ["node-red"]   // Filter by tag
        }]
    }
}
```

### Output Format

```javascript
msg.payload = {
    type: "event",
    content: {
        id: string,          // Event ID
        pubkey: string,      // Author's public key
        created_at: number,  // Unix timestamp
        kind: number,        // Event kind
        tags: string[][],    // Event tags
        content: string,     // Event content
        sig: string         // Event signature
    }
}
```

### Status Indicators

The nodes use standard Node-RED status indicators:
- üî¥ Red: Disconnected or error
- üü° Yellow: Connecting or processing
- üü¢ Green: Connected and ready

## Best Practices

1. **Key Management**:
   - Generate dedicated keys for automation
   - Never use your main Nostr identity
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Use Node-RED's credential encryption

2. **Relay Selection**:
   - Use reliable, well-known relays
   - Consider running your own relay for critical applications
   - Monitor relay health and performance
   - Configure multiple relays for redundancy

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Be mindful of relay resources
   - Implement appropriate delays
   - Filter events as specifically as possible
   - Use appropriate subscription filters
