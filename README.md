A [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) node for integrating with the Nostr protocol. This node allows you to connect to Nostr relays, publish events, and subscribe to events in the Nostr network.

## ⚠️ Security Note

A private key is **only required** if you want to:
- Publish events to relays
- Send encrypted direct messages
- Perform any action that requires signing

For just listening to relays or subscribing to events, **no private key is needed**.

If you do need to publish events, follow these security guidelines:

1. Generate a separate key pair specifically for your Node-RED automation using services like:
   - [nsec.app](https://nsec.app/)
   - [Alby](https://getalby.com/)
   - [Nostr.band](https://nostr.band/)

2. Keep the scope of this automation key limited:
   - Only give it permissions it actually needs
   - Consider it like a "bot account"
   - Regularly rotate the key if possible

3. Store the private key securely:
   - Use Node-RED's encrypted credentials
   - Never share or expose the key
   - Don't commit it to version control

## Description

This package provides nodes for interacting with Nostr relays, allowing you to:
- Connect to multiple relays simultaneously
- Monitor specific NPUBs for events
- Filter events by type (text notes, DMs, etc.)
- Post events to relays (using a dedicated automation key)
- Support for multiple NIPs (see Supported NIPs section)
- TypeScript support with full type definitions
- Secure credential management
- Automatic reconnection handling

## Technical Architecture

### Module System
This package uses a hybrid approach to module systems to ensure maximum compatibility:
- Built as CommonJS for Node-RED compatibility
- Handles ESM dependencies through dynamic imports
- Supports both modern and legacy Node.js environments

### WebSocket Management
Built on [nostr-websocket-utils](https://github.com/yourusername/nostr-websocket-utils) for enterprise-grade reliability:
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Smart backoff strategy for connection drops
- **Connection Health**: Built-in heartbeat monitoring
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper cleanup of resources
- **Debug Support**: Detailed logging

## Install

### From npm (Recommended)
Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-nostr
```

### From Source
```bash
cd ~/.node-red
git clone https://github.com/HumanjavaEnterprises/node-red-contrib-nostr.git
cd node-red-contrib-nostr
npm install
npm run build
```

### Using Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HumanjavaEnterprises/node-red-contrib-nostr.git
cd node-red-contrib-nostr
docker compose up -d
```

## Nodes

### 1. Nostr Relay Config Node
Configuration node for managing relay connections:
- Multiple relay support
- Secure private key storage
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Connection status monitoring
- Dynamic import of ESM dependencies

### 2. Nostr Filter Node
Specialized node for event filtering:
- Filter by event kinds
- Filter by authors (NPUBs)
- Filter by tags
- Time-based filtering
- Custom filter combinations
- Real-time event processing

### 3. Nostr NPUB Filter Node
Dedicated node for NPUB-based filtering:
- Monitor specific NPUBs
- Filter by event types
- Real-time NPUB event tracking
- Automatic hex key conversion

## Example Flows

### Basic Event Monitoring
```json
{
    "id": "basic-monitor",
    "type": "nostr-filter",
    "relay": "wss://relay.example.com",
    "filterType": "kind",
    "eventKinds": [1],
    "wires": [["debug"]]
}
```

### NPUB Tracking
```json
{
    "id": "npub-track",
    "type": "nostr-npub-filter",
    "relay": "wss://relay.example.com",
    "npubValue": "npub1...",
    "eventKinds": [1, 6],
    "wires": [["debug"]]
}
```

## Error Handling

The nodes implement comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid private key detection
- Relay connection failures
- Message parsing errors
- NPUB validation
- WebSocket connection issues

## Development

### Building from Source
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Unit tests for all nodes
- WebSocket connection handling
- Event filtering logic
- Error handling

### Docker Development
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
